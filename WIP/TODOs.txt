- implement undo
	just keep a previous version of grid state (and other global variables)

add vertex drag
	careful ordering: when clicking on first vertex --> not close instantly!
	1: only mark poly orange when clickhold
		active_poly_ind only >1 until clickhold = false!

flow: 

add hinge for each poly (can be dragged) --> for rotations, teleportations etc
	could be same pos as vertex --> need to set with keyboard

add rotation: store original coordinates, but set to nearest coordinates when rotated
when rotating always calculate from the original coords

decluster functions
	done for level_editor (REDO a little...)
	TODO for geometry functions (esp. fill coords!)



+++

- make function that moves verts (grid adjustment + coords adjustment)
- make function that moves polys (grid adjustment + coords adjustment)
- separate from functions that handle different cases (open_poly, how many verts)
	(1) "move_..."
	(2) "drag_..."
- rethink nomenclature (pos, verts, coords, cells)
